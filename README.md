# Team Page Challenge


### Requirements:
1. Create an inspiring and original ‘Meet the team page’ (e.g : https://www.frontfundr.com/ourteam, https://wistia.com/about/yearbook etc...)
2. Don’t focus on the other items of the page (navigation bar, header, footer etc.). We just needthe body of the page.
3. You can use any names and pictures you want/need. An employee has generally the following characteristics: Name, title, bio, picture(s). We let you decide the characteristics you want to display.
4. Technologies to use: HTML, Razor , Javascript (Jquey is strongly preferred) and CSS (Bootstap is strongly preferred).
5. Create this small project using Visual Studio (ASP.NET MVC with C#). Please create a ViewModel with the associated view (.cshtml) for the page.

This test intentionally contains few guidelines. We will assess your attention to details and your ability to follow requirements and create a good original UI with the required technologies.

Please return the completed project when you are finished and indicate the time you spent to complete the task.

Show us your creativity
